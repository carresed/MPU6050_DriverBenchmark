# MPU6050_DriverBenchmark
STM32F401 driver for MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope, implemented three ways: HAL (high-level), LL (low-layer), and bare-metal (register-level). Compares performance, memory usage, and efficiency. Includes UART debug, full docs, and extensible structure for other I2C/SPI sensors.
